## 4.0.0


### Breaking changes

- You are now required to define a `FileProvider` in your manifest for the SD-card picker [\#118](https://github.com/spacecowboy/NoNonsense-FilePicker/pull/118) ([spacecowboy](https://github.com/spacecowboy))

    
    Due to recent changes in Android 7.0 Nougat, bare File URIs can no longer be returned in a safe way. This change requires you to add an entry to your manifest to use the included `FilePickerFragment` and change how you handle the results.
    - You need to add the following to your app's `AndroidManifest.xml`:
    
    ``` xml
            <provider
                android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"
                android:authorities="${applicationId}.provider"
                android:exported="false"
                android:grantUriPermissions="true">
                <meta-data
                    android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                    android:resource="@xml/nnf_provider_paths" />
            </provider>
    ```
    - Then you must change your result handling. Here is a code snippet illustrating the change for a single result (the same applies to multiple results):
    
    ``` java
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
        // The URI will now be something like content://PACKAGE-NAME/root/path/to/file
        Uri uri = intent.getData();
        // A new utility method is provided to transform the URI to a File object
        File file = com.nononsenseapps.filepicker.Utils.getFileForUri(uri);
        // If you want a URI which matches the old return value, you can do
        Uri fileUri = Uri.fromFile(file);
        // Do something with the result...
    }
    ```
    
    This change was required in order to fix `FileUriExposedException` being thrown on Android 7.0 Nougat, as reported in [#115](https://github.com/spacecowboy/NoNonsense-FilePicker/issues/115) and [#107](https://github.com/spacecowboy/NoNonsense-FilePicker/issues/107).
