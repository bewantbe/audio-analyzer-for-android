# SD-card picker

The sample app demonstrates the SD-card file chooser in action. No configuration is necessary for that.


# Dropbox picker

If you want to try the Dropbox part of the sample, you'll need to get your own
API-keys at [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
and insert them into DropboxSyncHelper.java and AndroidManifest.xml. See Dropbox for more details
on that:

The dropbox sample uses the Core API. If you want to use the Sync API, have look at:

for an example of that.
